## About
A new source for whatever may need it. Freedom, privacy, and fundamental rights for all.

Randomness and projects to help the time go by. Let’s be positive and influence the world to keep on going on, don’t lose that drive.

Helping others is what this group is about. To maintain integrity which will keep rolling towards that eternal posture.

This is where it begins, being open(source).

## Purpose
Enjoy life. Learn and have fun.
Anybody can help, as new as you may be.
Anything you may dabble in, feel free to add.

All resources will be at the repository GuideOfAllThings.
A lot of sorting needs to be done.
